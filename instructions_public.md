# Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a dynamic and engaging mobile game app designed to help users learn new languages in a fun, interactive, and personalized way. Utilizing Flutter and Firebase for core functionalities, along with Flutter Flame for game mechanics, the app aims to provide a seamless and immersive user experience.

## Steps Overview

### Step 1: Project Setup
Establish the foundation for the project by setting up essential configurations, dependencies, and tools. This includes initializing the repository, integrating Firebase, installing dependencies, setting up environment variables, and defining the project structure.

### Step 2: User Authentication and Language Selection
Implement a secure user authentication system and allow users to select their preferred language during onboarding. This ensures personalized experiences and supports a multi-lingual user base.

### Step 3: Basic UI and Navigation
Establish the foundational user interface and navigation system, ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience for all app features. This includes implementing navigation, creating basic screens, ensuring responsive design, and integrating a service locator.

### Step 4: AI Integration and Flashcard System [In Progress]
Leverage AI-generated data to create personalized flashcards and interactive content for language learning. Implement the flashcard system using the `flutter_card_swiper` package, ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience.

### Step 5: Game Modes Development
Develop engaging game modes to make language learning interactive and enjoyable. These modes will cater to both single-player and multiplayer experiences, encouraging users to learn through challenges and competition.

### Step 6: Leveling System Implementation
Introduce a leveling system that tracks user progress, rewards accomplishments, and motivates users to engage with the app consistently. This system will also add a layer of personalization by adapting content based on user levels.

### Step 7: PVP Gameplay System
Develop a player-versus-player (PVP) system to create competitive and interactive gameplay experiences. This system will allow users to challenge others, enhancing engagement and offering an avenue for language learning through social interaction.

### Step 8: Reward System and Character Customization
Implement a reward system that motivates players by providing in-game incentives for achievements, and allow character customization for a personalized gaming experience. This step ensures users remain engaged and invested in their progression.

### Step 9: Analytics and Admin Dashboard
Implement analytics to track user behavior and performance metrics while providing users with an in-app dashboard to monitor their progress. This step ensures transparency and engagement by allowing users to see their achievements and activity.

### Step 10: Push Notifications
Implement push notifications to engage users by sending timely updates about their progress, game events, and reminders. Notifications help retain users and encourage continued app usage.

### Step 11: Subscription and Payment Integration
Integrate a subscription and payment system to offer users access to premium features and enhance monetization. This step ensures smooth and secure handling of in-app purchases and subscriptions.

### Step 12: Testing and Debugging
Ensure the app meets high-quality standards by thoroughly testing all implemented features and debugging issues. Maintain all test scripts in the `/test` directory to ensure organized and consistent testing.

### Step 13: Deployment
Deploy the app to production, ensuring it is optimized for performance and scalability. This includes configuring Firebase Cloud for hosting game data and other necessary adjustments.
